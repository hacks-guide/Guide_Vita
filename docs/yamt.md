### Required Reading

YAMT (Yet Another Mount Tool) is a multi-purpose kernel plugin for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for the use of a microSD card as a storage device via an SD2Vita adapter. The SD2Vita is a microSD to game card adapter which is inserted into the game-card slot in your device.

By using the YAMT kernel plugin, the USB drive or microSD card you use will be mounted to `ux0:` just like a Sony memory card. This is very useful because microSD cards are significantly cheaper than Sony memory cards (especially at higher capacities).

::: tip
If you're using a USB drive or psvsd adapter, or if this method doesn't work for you, follow the [StorageMgr](storagemgr) guide.
:::

::: tip
YAMT is only compatible with firmware versions 3.60 and 3.65 on HENkaku Ens≈ç.
:::

::: warning
Red Samsung Evo cards are not compatible with YAMT. If you have a Red Samsung Evo MicroSD card please follow the [StorageMgr](storagemgr) guide.

___

If you want to reclaim the space on your memory card (to use for storing PSP games for instance), you can delete the contents of `uma0:` (the new memory card mount point) and / or `imc0:` (if you have a PS Vita 2000 or PS TV).

If you decide to do this, you must *not* delete these folders if they exist:

  + `uma0:data/bootstrap.self`
  + `uma0:app/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:app/VITASHELL`
  + `uma0:appmeta/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:appmeta/VITASHELL`
  + `uma0:license/app/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:license/app/VITASHELL`
  + `uma0:user/00/savedata/PCSG90096`
  + `uma0:user/00/savedata/VITASHELL`

This is because you must keep h-encore installed to the memory card so you can enable HENkaku (and therefore YAMT) after a reboot.
