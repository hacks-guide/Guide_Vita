title: "Using HENlo"
---

### Required Reading

The HENlo exploit chain for the PS Vita (TV) allows for the installation of homebrew applications to the LiveArea Screen. It is compatible with the firmware versions 3.65 to 3.74.

Note that the HENlo chain is not "persistent" (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). Fortunately, this is only a temporary restriction until HENkaku Ens≈ç is installed on the next page.

In addition to running HENlo, we will also enable access to "unsafe" homebrew which gives extended permissions to homebrew applications. This idea could be considered analogous to the "administrator" mode on a computer.

The "VitaDeploy" application will also be installed to your home screen. VitaDeploy makes installing apps, plugins, and custom firmwares simple and includes many useful tools and utilites.

### What You Need

* An internet connection on your PS Vita (TV)
