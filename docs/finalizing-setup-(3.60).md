### Required Reading

We will now setup applications and plugins such as the following:

+  **iTLS Installer** *(adds TLSv1.2 support in older firmwares for online connection)*
+  **NoNpDrm** *(allows for encrypted games and applications to be used)*
+  **0syscall6** *(allows using games and applications that require higher firmware versions)*
+  **DownloadEnabler** *(allows any file type to be downloaded with the browser)*
+  **shellbat** *(displays exact battery percentage in the status bar)*
+  **pngshot** *(improves the built-in screenshot utility)*
+  **PSVshell** *(allows overclocking the PSVita for better performances as well as showing CPU usage and fps counter)*

In order to install the necessary `.vpk` (content package) file on your device, we use the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) to copy the files to your device's memory card.

### What You Need

* The latest release of [iTLS-Enso](https://github.com/SKGleba/iTLS-Enso/releases/latest/)
* The latest release of [NoNpDrm](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [0syscall6](https://github.com/SKGleba/0syscall6/releases/latest)
