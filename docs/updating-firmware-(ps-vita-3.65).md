### Required Reading

The h-encore exploit is only compatible with firmware versions 3.65 and above. As a result, other firmware versions must update using a custom update application in order to use that exploit.

While the h-encore exploit itself is compatible with higher firmware versions, users on a firmware version under 3.65 should only update to firmware version 3.65 as it is the latest version which still supports the Ens≈ç boot-time exploit.

Note that a custom update application can only update your device, not downgrade it. If you are on a firmware version higher than 3.65, you should return to [Get Started](get-started).

### What you need

* The `PSP2Updat.PUP` file corresponding to the firmware version you are attempting to update to
