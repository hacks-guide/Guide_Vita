title: Downgrading Firmware (3.65)
sidebar: false
---

### Required Reading

If your device was unable to downgrade to firmware version 3.60 due to its "factory firmware", you will still be able to use the more convenience Ensō boot-time exploit (as long as your "factory firmware" is 3.65 or lower) by downgrading to firmware version 3.65.

Unfortunately, you may experience minor software incompatibilities as you will not be able to use any homebrew which is only compatible with 3.60.

::: tip
Ensure your device has a battery charge of 50% or greater before proceeding.
