# Updating Firmware (3.74)

### Required Reading

The HENlo exploit is only compatible with the firmware versions 3.65, 3.68, and 3.74. As a result, lower firmware versions must update to the latest firmware to use the exploit. Updating the firmware is also the easiest method of uninstalling any previous installation of CFW on a used system.

### What you need

* An internet connection on your PS Vita (TV)

### Instructions

1. Navigate to `System Update` -> `Update Using Wi-Fi`
1. Ensure the update message "Version 3.74" is displayed
    + If it doesn't, clear your Wi-Fi DNS settings and try again
1. Follow the prompts to update your device to 3.74
    + When the process has completed, your device will reboot automatically
