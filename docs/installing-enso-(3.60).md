# Installing Ensō (3.60)

### Required Reading

Ensō is a complete CFW solution for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for convenient homebrew access on your device by running an exploit at boot-time to setup the HENkaku homebrew environment.

It is more convenient than HENkaku as it does not require you to trigger an exploit on your device after every reboot manually.

### What You Need

* An FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)
* The latest release of [Ensō (3.60)](https://github.com/henkaku/enso/releases/latest/)
* The latest release of [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases/latest)
