Now, you can continue following the guide by going to [Updating Firmware (3.74)](updating-firmware-(3.74)) and updating your Vita **even if you're on a version compatible with HENlo** (Unless you are already on the latest firmware, in that case you can skip updating and go straight to [Using HENlo](using-henlo)).
