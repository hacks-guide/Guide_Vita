### Required Reading

The HENkaku exploit is only compatible with the firmware version 3.60. As a result, lower firmware versions must update using a custom update server in order to use that exploit.

Note that a custom update server can only update your device, not downgrade it. If you are on a firmware version higher than 3.60, you should return to [Get Started](get-started).

### What you need

* An internet connection on your PS Vita (TV)

### Instructions

#### Section I: Prep Work

1. Launch the Settings application
1. Navigate to `Network` -> `Wi-Fi Settings`

#### Section II: Updating to 3.60
