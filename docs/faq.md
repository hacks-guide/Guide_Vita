### I am on the latest system version, is my device hackable?
Yes, firmware version 3.74 is hackable at the moment.

There is no need to update a PSVita with CFW. Stay on firmware version 3.60 or 3.65.

For support, ask for help at [Official Henkaku Discord](https://discord.gg/m7MwpKA).

You must have a computer if you are on firmware version 3.61 or higher.
