title: Installing h-encore
---

### Required Reading

The h-encore exploit for the PS Vita (TV) allows for the installation of homebrew applications to your home screen. It is compatible with the firmware versions 3.65 to 3.74.

Note that the h-encore exploit chain is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). This means you will have to run the exploit again after each reboot.

In addition to installing the h-encore exploit, we enable access to “unsafe” homebrew which gives extended permissions to homebrew applications. This idea could be considered analogous to the “administrator” mode on a computer.

If you are on firmware versions 3.65 to 3.68, you will be using the h-encore exploit, however if you are on firmware versions 3.69 to 3.74, you will be using the h-encore² exploit. The program we use to install the exploit to your console (finalhe) should sort this out for you.

::: tip
If you are unable to get the finalhe method to work for any reason, or if you own a Mac/Linux computer, the [QCMA Backup method](installing-h-encore-(qcma).md) will work as well.

::: tip
If you have a PS Vita 1000, you must also have an official Sony memory card (of any size) to follow this guide. This restriction does not apply to the PS Vita 2000 or PS TV as those devices have a built-in memory card.
