### Required Reading

These steps are for updating a HENkaku 3.60 device to a 3.65 HENkaku Ensō device. If you have a 3.60 HENkaku Ensō device and are trying to update to a 3.65 HENkaku Ensō device, follow [Updating to 3.65 (Ensō)](updating-to-3.65-(enso)).
{: .notice--warning}

HENkaku Ensō is a complete CFW solution for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for convenient homebrew access on your device by running an exploit at boot-time to setup the HENkaku homebrew environment. It is more convenient than HENkaku as it does not require you to trigger an exploit on your device after every reboot manually.

In addition to installing HENkaku Ensō, we will also update your PS Vita (TV) to the firmware version 3.65 which will allow you to access the PS Store, use online features, and play newer games which require newer firmware versions.

Note that updating your device to the firmware version 3.65 will render the standard HENkaku exploit unusable. Should you remove HENkaku Ensō for some reason, you will need to follow [Installing h-encore](installing-h-encore) to reinstall it.

In order to install the necessary `.vpk` (content package) files on your device, we use the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) to copy the files to your device's memory card. 

### What You Need

* An FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)
* The latest release of [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell/releases/latest/)
* The latest release of [update365](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/update365/releases/latest) *(the `.PUP` and `.vpk` files)*
