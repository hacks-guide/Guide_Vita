title: "Configuring h-encore"

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

### Required Reading

Now that the h-encore exploit is installed on your device (either through the Windows or Linux / Mac method), we will configure it for easy homebrew access.
  
### Instructions

#### Section I - Configuring h-encore

1. Launch the h-encore application
1. If prompted about trophies, select "Yes"
1. If the exploit was successful, you will now see the h-encore bootstrap menu
  + If the exploit is stuck on a white screen, simply close the application (which will cause a crash and reboot your device), then try again
  + If it is still stuck, hold the power button down for over 30 seconds to force a reboot, then try again
1. Select "Install HENkaku"
  + This will install the HENkaku exploit and enable homebrew access until the next reboot
1. Select "Download VitaShell"
  + This will install the VitaShell homebrew application for managing your device's filesystem
  + VitaShell (and all homebrew applications in general) will remain installed after a reboot, but will give an error on launch if the HENkaku exploit is not active
1. Select "Exit"

#### Section II - Configuring HENkaku

1. Launch the Settings application
1. Navigate to `HENkaku Settings`
  + If HENkaku Settings is missing, select the "Reset taiHEN config.txt" in the h-encore bootstrap menu, then try again
1. Check "Enable Unsafe Homebrew"
1. Return to HENkaku Settings menu
1. Close the Settings application

#### Section III - Disabling Trophy Warning

{% capture notice-1 %}
This is an optional section which will disable the trophy warning that appears when h-encore is launched. 

This section is not recommended for devices on firmware version 3.65 as Ensō can replace h-encore on those systems.
{% endcapture %}

#### Firmware Versions 3.67 and 3.68
