### Required Reading

These steps are for updating a *stock* device to 3.65. If you have already hacked your PS Vita (TV) before and are running HENkaku Ensō on 3.60, follow [Updating to (Ensō) 3.65](updating-to-(enso)-3.65).
{: .notice--danger}

The hencore exploit is only compatible with the firmware version 3.65, 3.67, and 3.68. As a result, lower firmware versions must update using a custom update server in order to use the exploit.

While the h-encore exploit itself is compatible with firmware versions 3.67 and 3.68, we will be updating to firmware version 3.65 as it is the latest version which still supports the HENkaku Ensō boot-time exploit.

Note that a custom update server can only update your device, not downgrade it. If you are on a firmware version higher than 3.65, you should return to [Get Started](get-started).
