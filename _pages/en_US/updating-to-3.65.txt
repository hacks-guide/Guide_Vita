### Required Reading

This will update your PS Vita to system version 3.65 in preparation for the new HENkaku exploit. The exploit only runs on 3.65 and above, so you'll need to update to that before you can proceed.

*Do not* update through the system to 3.68. You cannot install HENkaku Ensō on system versions 3.67 and above. HENkaku Ensō allows you to run homebrew automatically on boot.

This guide is for updating to *STOCK* 3.65. If you are looking to update to HENkaku Ensō 3.65 from 3.60, follow [this guide](updating-to-henkaku-enso-3.65).
