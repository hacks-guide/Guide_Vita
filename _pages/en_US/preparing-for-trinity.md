title: Preparing for Trinity

### Required Reading

The latest PS Vita (TV) exploit (dubbed 'Trinity') requires you to install software from the PS Store and perform other preparation before installation. The hack exploits bugs in the built-in emulators used to run PSP games and PSP minis to modify the system.

Since the exploit uses games existing only online, on the PS Store, it's important to download it as soon as possible in the event that Sony patches the exploit in the future. Your device must be linked and activated with a PSN account to allow you to download the PSP games from the PS Store. The instructions on how to do this are detailed below.

If you have a PS Vita 1000, you must also have an official Sony memory card (of any size) to follow this guide. This restriction does not apply to the PS Vita 2000 or PS TV as those devices have a built-in memory card.
