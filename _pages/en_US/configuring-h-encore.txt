### Required Reading

If your device was unable to downgrade to either 3.60 or 3.65 due to its "factory firmware", you will be unable to use the more convenient Ensō boot-time exploit.

As a result, you will have to perform the h-encore exploit manually after each reboot. To make this slightly more convenient, we will disable the "trophy warning" that currently appears on every launch of the h-encore exploit.

### Instructions

#### Section I - Disabling Trophy Warning

1. Launch the h-encore application while holding (R)
1. Select "Personalize savedata"
1. Select "Exit"
