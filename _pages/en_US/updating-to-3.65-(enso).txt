### Required Reading

These steps are for updating a 3.60 HENkaku Ensō device to 3.65 (while retaining HENKaku Ensō). If you have a stock device and are trying to update to 3.65, follow [Updating to 3.65](updating-to-3.65).
{: .notice--warning}

HENkaku Ensō is a complete CFW solution for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for convenient homebrew access on your device by running an exploit at boot-time to setup the HENkaku homebrew environment. It is more convenient than HENkaku as it does not require you to manually trigger an exploit on your device after every reboot.

In addition to installing HENkaku Ensō, we will also update your PS Vita (TV) to the firmware version 3.65 which will allow you to access the PS Store, use online features, and play newer games which require newer firmware versions.

Note that updating your device to the firmware version 3.65 will render the standard HENkaku exploit unusable. Should you remove HENkaku Ensō after updating, you will need to follow [Installing h-encore](installing-h-encore) to reinstall it.

In order to install the necessary `.vpk` (content package) files on your device, we use the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) to copy the files to your device's memory card. 

If you have a PS Vita 1000, you must also have an official Sony memory card (of any size) to follow this guide. An SD2Vita device will not work for this update process. This restriction does not apply to the PS Vita 2000 or PS TV as those devices have a built-in memory card.
