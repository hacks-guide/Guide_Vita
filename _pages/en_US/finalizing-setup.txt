### Required Reading

To make your homebrew setup more resilient to user-error, we will use an application called HBInjector to replace one of your device's system applications with VitaShell. This will allow VitaShell to survive even formatting the system.

When HBInjector is used, a backup of the original system application is created which will allow you to restore that application to normal at any time.

Note that, as part of the HBInjector injection process, the system database will be rebuilt which will cause your LiveArea layout to be reset.

In addition to installing VitaShell as a system application, we also setup applications and plugins such as the following:    

+  **Vita Homebrew Browser** *(downloads and installs other homebrew applications)*
+  **NoNpDrm** *(allows for decrypted games and applications to be used)*
+  **DownloadEnabler** *(allows any file type to be downloaded with the browser)*
+  **shellbat** *(displays exact battery percentage in the status bar)*

### What You Need

* An FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)

  + The `ur0:` partition corresponds to the internal system memory which is always present on all devices (on the PS Vita 2000 and PS TV this is *not* the same as the built-in memory card!)
1. Transfer `HBInjector.vpk` to the `data` folder
1. Transfer `VitaHBBrowser.vpk` to the `data` folder
1. Using your FTP client, navigate to `ux0:` -> `tai/`
