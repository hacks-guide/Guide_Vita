You can browse for new homebrew applications on [VitaDB](https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/) or in the [Vita Homebrew Browser](https://github.com/devnoname120/vhbb/releases/latest/). Please note that Vita Homebrew Browser may take up to 15 minutes to load on first use.
{: .notice--info}

It is *not* recommended to make modifications to your Custom Firmware installation by installing homebrew applications intended for advanced users (such as "Enso EX"). Doing so without fully understanding the system can lead to a BRICK!
{: .notice--danger}

Do *not* use AutoPlugin II. It does not always install the plugins correctly, contains many outdated versions of plugins, fails to teach you how to manually install plugins and makes it very hard for people to assist you when things go wrong.
