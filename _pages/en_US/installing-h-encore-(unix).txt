### Required Reading

The h-encore exploit for the PS Vita (TV) allows for the installation of homebrew applications to your home screen. It is compatible with the firmware versions 3.65 to 3.68.

Note that the h-encore exploit chain is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). This means you will have to run the exploit again after each reboot.

In addition to installing the h-encore exploit, we enable access to “unsafe” homebrew which gives extended permissions to homebrew applications. This idea could be considered analogous to the “administrator” mode on a computer.

The h-encore installation is performed manually and requires the use of the command line. MacOS or Linux is required for this guide.

Downgrading with modoru while using the h-encore on firmware 3.71 and above can stop your device from working. Do not downgrade your device until further notice.

If you have a PS Vita 1000, you must also have an official Sony memory card (of any size) to follow this guide. This restriction does not apply to the PS Vita 2000 or PS TV as those devices have a built-in memory card.
