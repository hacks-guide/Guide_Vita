title: Downgrading Firmware (3.60)
---

### Required Reading

We will now downgrade your device to firmware version 3.60 as it is the best supported firmware version which supports the Ensō boot-time exploit.

Ensō is a complete CFW solution for the PS Vita (TV) which allows for convenient homebrew access on your device by running an exploit at boot-time to setup the HENkaku homebrew environment.

It is more convenient than h-encore and Trinity as it does not require you to trigger an exploit on your device after every reboot manually.

While it is possible to run homebrew on your current firmware version using either h-encore, Trinity or Ensō, downgrading to firmware version 3.60 will provide you with the greatest homebrew compatibility.

Since the release of the reF00D system plugin, there are very few (if any) downsides to running firmware version 3.60 as this plugin allows you to install and play games which would normally require a newer firmware version.

Unfortunately, a very small number of devices will be unable to downgrade to 3.60 due to their "factory firmware" version. Further instructions will be presented when relevant for users who encounter this situation.

Ensure your device has a battery charge of 50% or greater before proceeding.
