### Required Reading

HENkaku is an exploit chain for the PS Vita (TV) which will allow for the installation of homebrew applications to the LiveArea Screen. It is only compatible with the firmware version 3.60.

Note that the HENkaku exploit chain is not "persistent" (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). Fortunately, this is only a temporary restriction until HENkaku Ensō is installed on the next page.

In addition to running the HENkaku exploit, we will also enable access to "unsafe" homebrew which gives extended permissions to homebrew applications. This idea could be considered analagous to the "administrator" mode on a computer.

If you have a PS Vita 1000, you must also have an official Sony memory card (of any size) to follow this guide. This restriction does not apply to the PS Vita 2000 or PS TV as those devices have a built-in memory card.
